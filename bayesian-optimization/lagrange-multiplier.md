# Lagrange Multipliers

The Langrange multiplier is used to optimize some function $f$ subject to a constraint $g$.

### Example

Suppose we want to maximize the function $f(x,y)=x^2y$ on the set $x^2+y^2=1$.

We can then vary the contour lines of $f$ until is it tangent to $g$. Since the gradient vector is always perpendicular to the contour lines, when the contour line of $f$ is tangent to $g$, the gradient of each are linearly dependent. More formally:

$$\nabla{f}(x^*,y^*)$$
